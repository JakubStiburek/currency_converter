# Currency convertor

A simple currency convertor CLI written as an exercise as I'm learning Rust.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `cargo b`
3. You can find the binary in the `target` folder
4. Run `$[binary location] --help` to see how to use the CLI


## Todo

- [ ] Switch the source of currency rates (possibly EU bank)
- [ ] Cache currency rates for one day
- [ ] Add table of currency rates (using [cli-table](https://crates.io/crates/cli-table))
